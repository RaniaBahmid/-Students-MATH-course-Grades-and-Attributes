In this project, I have used python language to analyses and provide descriptive statistics of students’ attributes and grades for math course in school dataset in order to answer some analysis questions includes: which period had the students performed better grades? do students who have their parent's living together have performed better grades than students who have their parent's living apart? Does parental level of education affect their children exam scores? Does study time influence students’ performance? and other questions that I was interested in. In addition, I applied machine learning to predict the final grade based on some attributes were given.
