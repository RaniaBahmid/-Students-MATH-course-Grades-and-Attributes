In this project, I have used python language to analyses and provide descriptive statistics of students’ attributes and grades for math course in school dataset in order to answer some analysis questions includes: which period had the students performed better grades? do students who have their parent's living together have performed better grades than students who have their parent's living apart? Does parental level of education affect their children exam scores? Does study time influence students’ performance? and other questions that I was interested in. In addition, I applied machine learning to predict the final grade based on some attributes were given.

The dataset used is about students’ math course grades and 26 attributes that will explore if it is related to the students’ performance. It contains three periods of exam grades and some information related to the student’s family such as size and education. Also, demographic, social and school related features were a part of this dataset. These data have been used to analysis student performance and predict the final grade.

The dataset contains 10270 elements, 395 rows and 26 attributes which are 'school','sex','address','famsize','Pstatus' ,'Mjob', 'Fjob', 'reason', 'guardian', 'activities', 'nursery', 'higher','internet' where the datatype is object. 'famrel','freetime','health','absences','G1','G2','G3'traveltime', 'studytime','failures', 'Medu', 'Fedu''age' that have int64 data type.
